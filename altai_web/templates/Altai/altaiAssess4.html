                    <span style="position: static;"> A crucial component of achieving Trustworthy AI is transparency which encompasses three elements: 1) traceability, 2) explainability and 3) open communication about the limitations of the AI system. Technical robustness requires that AI systems be developed with a preventative approach to risks and in a manner such that they reliably behave as intended while minimising unintentional and unexpected harm, and preventing unacceptable harm. This should also apply to potential changes in their operating environment or the presence of other agents (human and artificial) that may interact with the system in an adversarial manner. In addition, the physical and mental integrity of humans should be ensured.</span></h5>

                <h3> Explainability </h3>
            </div>
            <div> This subsection helps to self-assess the explainability of the AI system. The questions refer to the ability to explain both the technical processes of the AI system and the reasoning behind the decisions or predictions that the AI system makes. Explainability is crucial for building and maintaining usersí trust in AI systems. AI driven decisions ñ to the extent possible ñ must be explained and understood to those directly and indirectly affected, in order to allow for contesting of such decisions. An explanation as to why a model has generated a particular output or decision (and what combination of input factors contributed to that) is not always possible. These cases are referred to as ëblack boxes' and require special attention. In those circumstances, other explainability measures (e.g. traceability, auditability and transparent communication on the AI system capabilities) may be required, provided that the AI system as a whole respects fundamental rights. The degree to which explainability is needed depends on the context and the severity of the consequences of erroneous or otherwise inaccurate output to human lives.</div>
