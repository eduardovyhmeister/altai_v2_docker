                    <span style="position: static;"> In line with the principles of fairness and prevention of harm, the broader society, other sentient beings and the environment should be considered as stakeholders throughout the AI system's life cycle. Ubiquitous exposure to social AI systems in all areas of our lives (be it in education, work, care or entertainment) may alter our conception of social agency, or negatively impact our social relationships and attachment. While AI systems can be used to enhance social skills, they can equally contribute to their deterioration. This could equally affect peoples' physical and mental well-being. The effects of AI systems must therefore be carefully monitored and considered. Sustainability and ecological responsibility of AI systems should be encouraged, and research should be fostered into AI solutions addressing areas of global concern, for instance the Sustainable Development Goals. Overall, AI should be used to benefit all human beings, including future generations. AI systems should serve to maintain and foster democratic processes and respect the plurality of values and life choices of individuals. AI systems must not undermine democratic processes, human deliberation or democratic voting systems or pose a systemic threat to society at large.</span></h5>

            <div>This subsection helps to self-assess the (potential) positive and negative impacts of the AI system on the environment. AI systems, even if they promise to help tackle some of the most pressing societal concerns, e.g. climate change, must work in the most environmentally friendly way possible. The AI system’s development, deployment and use process, as well as its entire supply chain, should be assessed in this regard (e.g. via a critical examination of the resource usage and energy consumption during training, opting for less net negative choices). Measures to secure the environmental friendliness of an AI system’s entire supply chain should be encouraged.</div>
