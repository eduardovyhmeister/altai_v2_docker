This topic is closely related to risk management, identifying and mitigating risks in a transparent way that can be explained to and audited by third parties. When unjust or adverse impacts occur, accessible mechanisms for accountability should be in place that ensure an adequate possibility of redress.</span></h5>

    <h3>Auditability</h3>
</div>
<div>This subsection helps to self-assess the existing or necessary level that would be required for an evaluation of the AI system by internal and external auditors. The possibility to conduct evaluations as well as to access records on said evaluations can contribute to Trustworthy AI. In applications affecting fundamental rights, including safety-critical applications, AI systems should be able to be independently audited. This does not necessarily imply that information about business models and intellectual property related to the AI system must always be openly available.</div>

            </div>
            <div>Both the ability to report on actions or decisions that contribute to the AI system's outcome, and to respond to the consequences of such an outcome, must be ensured. Identifying, assessing, documenting and minimising the potential negative impacts of AI systems is especially crucial for those (in)directly affected. Due protection must be available for whistle-blowers, NGOs, trade unions or other entities when reporting legitimate concerns about an AI system.
                When implementing the above requirements, tensions may arise between them, which may lead to inevitable trade- offs.Such trade - offs should be addressed in a rational and methodological manner within the state of the art.This entails that relevant interests and values implicated by the AI system should be identified and that, if conflict arises, trade- offs should be explicitly acknowledged and evaluated in terms of their risk to safety and ethical principles, including fundamental rights.Any decision about which trade - off to make should be well reasoned and properly documented.When adverse impact occurs, accessible mechanisms should be foreseen that ensure adequate redress.</div>
