                    <span style="position: static;"> AI systems should support human autonomy and decision-making, as prescribed by the principle of respect for human autonomy. This requires that AI systems should both act as enablers to a democratic, flourishing and equitable society by supporting the user's agency and upholding fundamental rights, which should be underpinned by human oversight. In this section, we are asking you to assess the AI system in terms of the respect for human agency, as well as human oversight.</span></h5>

                <div style="display: inline-block; width:80%;">This subsection deals with the effect AI systems can have on human behaviour in the broadest sense. It deals with the effect of AI systems that are aimed at guiding, influencing or supporting humans in decision making processes, for example, algorithmic decision support systems, risk analysis/prediction systems (recommender systems, predictive policing, financial risk analysis, etc.). It also deals with the effect on human perception and expectation when confronted with AI systems that 'act' like humans. Finally, it deals with the effect of AI systems on human affection, trust and (in)dependence.</div>

AI systems can sometimes be deployed to shape and influence human behaviour through mechanisms that may be difficult to detect, since they may harness sub-conscious processes, including various forms of unfair manipulation, deception, herding and conditioning, all of which may threaten individual autonomy. The overall principle of user autonomy must be central to the system’s functionality.EGTAI p. 16.>

            <div>This subsection helps to self-assess necessary oversight measures through governance mechanisms such as human-in-the-loop (HITL), human-on-the-loop (HOTL), or human-in-command (HIC) approaches. Human-in-the-loop refers to the capability for human intervention in every decision cycle of the system. Human-on-the-loop refers to the capability for human intervention during the design cycle of the system and monitoring the system’s operation. Human-in-command refers to the capability to oversee the overall activity of the AI system (including its broader economic, societal, legal and ethical impact) and the ability to decide when and how to use the AI system in any particular situation. The latter can include the decision not to use an AI system in a particular situation to establish levels of human discretion during the use of the system, or to ensure the ability to override a decision made by an AI system.</div>
