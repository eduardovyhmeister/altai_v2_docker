            </div>

            The following tables cover the detection classification ranking. As observed, there are two tables in its use. The first defines the detection capacity of failing conditions based on the products (e.g. inspection of products), while the second is based on the detection of system control failures.

AI systems can either use symbolic rules or learn a numeric model, and they can also adapt their behaviour by analysing how the environment is affected by their previous actions. As a scientific discipline, AI includes several approaches and techniques, such as machine learning (of which deep learning and reinforcement learning are specific examples), machine reasoning (which includes planning, scheduling, knowledge representation and reasoning, search, and optimization), and robotics (which includes control, perception, sensors and actuators, as well as the integration of all other techniques into cyber-physical systems). &quot;>AI system</a>?     <a  tabindex=&quot;0&quot;  role=&quot;button&quot;  class=&quot;text-nowrap&quot; data-html=&quot;true&quot; data-trigger=&quot;focus&quot; data-placement=&quot;bottom&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; title=&quot;Help&quot; aria-label=&quot;Help navigationButton&quot;data-content=&quot;AI systems should support individuals in making better, more informed choices in accordance with their goals. AI systems can sometimes be deployed to shape and influence human behaviour through mechanisms that may be difficult to detect, since they may harness sub-conscious processes, including various forms of unfair manipulation, deception, herding and conditioning, all of which may threaten individual autonomy. The overall principle of user autonomy must be central to the system’s functionality.<br /><br />EGTAI p. 16.&quot; ><i class=&quot;far fa-question-circle&quot;></i></a >" id="sq_108_ariaTitle">
