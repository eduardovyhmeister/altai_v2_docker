                    <h3>Ranking Severity Classification</h3>
            </div>

            A severity classification is helpful to provide a qualitative measure of the potential resulting consequences from a failing item.
            Therefore, a severity classification should be assigned for each failure mode and analysed component. If no categories can be defined, 
            a similarity with loss statements based upon loss of system inputs or outputs shall be developed and included within the FMEA/FMECA ground rules.
            A multi-failure description should determine the severity level that considers each ethical-based FMECA issue. 
            The table shows a proposition based on considerations of ethical and security-based concerns. 
            This table will feed the critical matrix by setting severity categories with a critical number.

            The severity code imposes the definition of low, minor, and significant injury. these levels imply:

            <li> Low-level exposure: An exposure at less than 25% of published Threshold Limit Value (TLV)  or Short Term Exposure Limit (STEL). </li>
            <li> Minor Injury: A slight burn, light electrical shock, minor cut or pinch. First aid can handle these and are not OSHA recordable or considered as lost time cases. </li>
            <li> Significant Injury: Requires medical attention other than first aid. This is a medical risk condition. </li>

            Prioritization is given to the system based on the ES&H scale. If the levels based on this scale are acceptable under the institution's risk appetite, the severity ranking based on customer satisfaction could be used next

AI systems can either use symbolic rules or learn a numeric model, and they can also adapt their behaviour by analysing how the environment is affected by their previous actions. As a scientific discipline, AI includes several approaches and techniques, such as machine learning (of which deep learning and reinforcement learning are specific examples), machine reasoning (which includes planning, scheduling, knowledge representation and reasoning, search, and optimization), and robotics (which includes control, perception, sensors and actuators, as well as the integration of all other techniques into cyber-physical systems). &quot;>AI system</a>?     <a  tabindex=&quot;0&quot;  role=&quot;button&quot;  class=&quot;text-nowrap&quot; data-html=&quot;true&quot; data-trigger=&quot;focus&quot; data-placement=&quot;bottom&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; title=&quot;Help&quot; aria-label=&quot;Help navigationButton&quot;data-content=&quot;AI systems should support individuals in making better, more informed choices in accordance with their goals. AI systems can sometimes be deployed to shape and influence human behaviour through mechanisms that may be difficult to detect, since they may harness sub-conscious processes, including various forms of unfair manipulation, deception, herding and conditioning, all of which may threaten individual autonomy. The overall principle of user autonomy must be central to the system’s functionality.<br /><br />EGTAI p. 16.&quot; ><i class=&quot;far fa-question-circle&quot;></i></a >" id="sq_108_ariaTitle">
