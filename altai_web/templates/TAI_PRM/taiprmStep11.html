            </div>

            Folllowing figure shows the flowchart associated to the 4T's of risk management. The first decision node points to the user to identify if a new failure mode needs to be included. 
            When the user must execute the action, is driven to a decision node named will separate those new conditions and send them through checking alternatives for the 4T's.

            <div>
                <a><img src="{% static 'img/TAIPRM7.jpg' %}" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;margin-bottom: 10px; max-height: 420px; max-width: auto;" alt="Insight Centre for Data Analytics Logo" /> </a>
            </div>




            When the user do not identify new failure modes, then the decision node "modified KPI risk apetite?"" checks if there were modifications on the risk appetite. If positive, additional KPIs are considered for the risk management process. If negative, the user must evaluate "improved high e-risk?". In this case, the question guides the user to understand if e-risks have been evaluated in a robust mode generating quality enough to finalise the process. 
            If no further system modifications or iteration on KPI analyses is identified, the process ends.

            Otherwise, before to execute the activity Risk Apetite, previous historical records must be analysed to understand the improvement.

            The activity Risk Apetite checks if modifications are needed on the risk apetite based on policies established for the risk management process. This means to set up further and stringent conditions for the risks under consideration or to evaluate alternatives to manage the identified risks. This activity, once finished, should start the 4T’s analysis.

        <h3> Risk Appetite  </h3>

        The risk appetite imposes the corrective actions for the risks (i.e. treat, transfer, terminate or tolerate) in the function of the risk scores and the desire of the user to deal with their risk components. Therefore, these specifications should be defined in the risk policies and easily translated to functional risk matrixes.

            * This table represent the risk levels for the different intrinsic risk levels of AI assets. If you want to modify consider, based on the definitions of Step 2 (reported in step 3), which intrinsic risk you should consider for modification. The table is read from left to right increasing from the level of previous column (+1) up to the limit set on the current column.

        <h3> Definitions for results </h3>

        Recomendations are based on some specific characteristcs of the data structure and functionalities of your AI. Please respond the following questions in order to construct your recommendations.

        Some of these set of questions are relevant ONLY if the combination of the risks appetite and the RPN combined for your asset define that your AI needs treatment.
