                    <h3>Likelihood Classification</h3>
            </div>

            A likelihood or occurrence ranking metric helps measure how frequently an analysed failure mode could occur. The probability of occurrence (Pf) should be based on the failure mode's probability of occurring during operation time. The time frame's homogenisation should be based on an hourly or a 1E-6 hourly base for each failure mode considered. This designation of time frame is used since its commonly used also in criticality analyses.
            In case the process is sporadic, The last of the following tables could be used. Even though this distinction could obtain different rankings, as long as homogenization is performed for each classification, the shift in ranking would be homogenized in the end analysis. The first of the following tables shows the ranking and occurrence level in function of the description or designation of the occurrence.
            A critical characteristic of the occurrences ratios for some intrinsic algorithmic processes is that confusion matrixes estimations could estimate them. These numbers could be used directly for specific robustness-based failure modes. We, ASSISTANT, recommend its use if readily available. This approach is considered within the pipeline process of the proposed framework.

            Each occurrence is considered during the system/part/sub-part/component operating time or the ratio of item build with failing conditions during the operating time. The normalisation comes from the operating time specification (e.g. hourly or 1E-6 hourly).

AI systems can either use symbolic rules or learn a numeric model, and they can also adapt their behaviour by analysing how the environment is affected by their previous actions. As a scientific discipline, AI includes several approaches and techniques, such as machine learning (of which deep learning and reinforcement learning are specific examples), machine reasoning (which includes planning, scheduling, knowledge representation and reasoning, search, and optimization), and robotics (which includes control, perception, sensors and actuators, as well as the integration of all other techniques into cyber-physical systems). &quot;>AI system</a>?     <a  tabindex=&quot;0&quot;  role=&quot;button&quot;  class=&quot;text-nowrap&quot; data-html=&quot;true&quot; data-trigger=&quot;focus&quot; data-placement=&quot;bottom&quot; data-toggle=&quot;popover&quot; title=&quot;Help&quot; aria-label=&quot;Help navigationButton&quot;data-content=&quot;AI systems should support individuals in making better, more informed choices in accordance with their goals. AI systems can sometimes be deployed to shape and influence human behaviour through mechanisms that may be difficult to detect, since they may harness sub-conscious processes, including various forms of unfair manipulation, deception, herding and conditioning, all of which may threaten individual autonomy. The overall principle of user autonomy must be central to the system’s functionality.<br /><br />EGTAI p. 16.&quot; ><i class=&quot;far fa-question-circle&quot;></i></a >" id="sq_108_ariaTitle">
